# KI-All News

Know It All News: Be in the know of what's happening around the world!
---
### Getting Started
---
These instructions are intended to help you start building a similar project from scratch.

We will be setting up and building a test-driven front-end application that takes advantage of the functionalities NewsAPI provides. The application should be similar to a modern RSS feed that allows you to view all headlines from different news sources and link to the original articles/news on those sources.

Start by creating a local directory for your project, by running `$ mkdir my-project && cd my-project` in the command line.
Then run `$ npm init` to create a `package.json` file (This is the file that helps you manage locally installed npm packages for your project.)

Now we can start installing the requirements for our project.
